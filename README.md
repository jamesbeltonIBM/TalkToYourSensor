# TalkToYourSensor
This repository contains the 2 Node-RED flows and 1 Watson Conversation json file required to complete the excellent 'Talk to your Sensor using the Watson IoT Platform and Conversation services' Recipe on developerWorks by Christophe Lucas BUT using a mySQL database service (such as ClearDB) as opposed to dashDB / DB2 Warehouse.

The link to the original tutorial is:
https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/talk-to-your-sensor-using-the-watson-iot-platform-and-conversation-services/

In using these nodes, you will need to create a mySQL service and you will need to configure your nodes with mySQL connection information. You can find out more about how to do that in my post which is here:
